To Install:
-run `bundle install` as the user who will be runing the server processes.

-Install the following on the server.
  - firefox

Server notes:
The application will need at least 1gb of Ram and a 4gb swap file.
Using Unicorn and Nginx to host is very effective.
Be sure that the user running Nginx and Unicorn has ownership of the Gem Files.
